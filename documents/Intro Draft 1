The simplest element of evolution is Darwin's idea of 'survival of the fittest'-i.e., the organisms that are best-adapted to their environments and are thus able to replicate the quickest, will outcompete their rivals (Darwin, 1859).  However, the theory of 'survival of the flattest' states that in certain high-mutation environments, selection favors organisms with higher mutational robustness  (even if their replication rate is lower) than organisms with low mutational robustness but high replication rates (Wilke et al., 2001; Codoñer et al., 2006; Sanjuán et al., 2007).  This phenomenon was originally illustrated using digital organisms (Wilke et al., 2001), but has recently been supported in vivo in plant viroids (Codoñer et al., 2006) and the vesicular stomatitis RNA virus (Sanjuán et al., 2007)
The molecular evolutionary theory of quasispecies  predicts how a population may evolve mutational robustness.  This model predicts that selection will maximize the average replication rate of the entire cloud of genotypes that are connected by mutations rather than solely selecting for the genotype with the highest mutation rate (Eigen, 1971; Schuster and Swetina, 1988; Nowak, 1992).  Thus, mutation itself becomes a selective force that affects the genome in a way that makes the quasispecies robust against mutation (Wilke et al., 2001).  
The exact nature of the effects on the genome that cause quasispecies to become mutationally robust is unclear.   One phenomenon that may be related to mutational robustness is the prevalence of opportunities for neutral mutations.  It has been argued that due to the high rates of nucleotide substitutions fixed in natural populations, the vast majority of mutations that occur must be neutral (Kimura, 1983). Neutral mutations can occur when the nucleotide change still results in the same amino acid (Freeland and Hurst, 1998), or if the mutation occurs in a redundant gene or intron (Yu and Miller, 2002). Having a higher number of sites in the genome at which neutral mutations can occur will increase the mutational robustness of an organism and can also increase the evolvability of an organism if neutral muations become "visible" and cause a phenotype when the organism's environment or genotype changes (Wagner, 2005; Wagner, 2008)
This study was designed to examine the genomic differences between two populations of organisms evolved from the same ancestor pool in the digital evolution software platform Avida. Population A consisted of organisms evolved at a low mutation rate, creating organisms with a relatively high replication rate as compared to Population B, which was evolved at a high mutation rate to produce organisms with a relatively low replication rate but greater mutational robustness.  We hypothesized that Population B would have higher levels of gene overlap and genome modularity than Population A, which would allow Population B to have a larger number of sites in the genome at which a neutral mutation could occur.  We generated pairs of organisms by evolving common ancestors at low and high mutation rates and competed the pairs to test that the "flat" members of each pair (evolved at high mutation rates) were able to outcompete the "fit" member of each pair (Wilke et al., 2001).  We then used functional genomic mapping and modularity analysis commands in Avida to determine how Populations A and B differ at the genomic level.
